# Master: JobTracker host and  NameNode host
# Probably should have separate VM's for jobtracker and namenode.
# Ignore "start failed: message.
apt-get -y install hadoop-0.20-mapreduce-jobtracker hadoop-hdfs-namenode hadoop-client

# Upload and run on ALL VM's.
# This is mainly for the master. 
# Maybe not necessary to apply the entire script to the slaves as some of the 
# directories will be for client apps only.
# If hadoop components are installed after this the relevant section in the script
# MUST be executed in isolation.
